# TO-DO-LIST

The todo list project would be a web application that allows users to create, store, update, delete, and sort tasks. Users would be able to enter a task description and then save it to a database for future reference.

To make it easier to manage tasks in bulk, the interface would include a SELECT ALL button that would allow users to select all tasks at once, and a DESELECT ALL button that would clear any existing selections. This would be particularly useful for users who have many tasks to manage at once and want to quickly mark them as complete or delete them.

In addition to the basic task management features, the todo list project would also include a DARK MODE theme. This would provide an alternative color scheme for users who prefer a darker interface, or who work in low-light environments. The DARK MODE theme would reduce the strain on the user's eyes and make it easier to use the application for extended periods of time.

The project would also include a Profile bar, which would allow users to manage their account settings and preferences. Users could access their account information, change their password, and update their personal information.
